## Contribute

You can contribute to this project, by adding in features that provide more detailed information about a given user's zodiac sign. One example could be requesting from the user more detailed informations such as the geolocation of a user's birth place, the exact time of birth. This would provide more specific birth chart planetary information, beyond just the Sun Sign!

#### [Reflection](project_documents/reflection.md)

This project was great practice in integrating an app's Front-End and Back-End, as well as hands on practice with hosting my project, creating an API function, processing incoming requests and connecting my server to an API Gateway.
can find my reflection notes within the Project_documents directory. Contains learned material, code design decisions, and the evolution progress of the app.
